# Alarm-Clock
An ESP32 based alarm clock

This is a bedside alarm clock and light controller I developed. IT relies on a number of external libraries:

DarkSky Weather by Bodmer
  TFT_eSPI by Bodmer
  JSON_Decoder by Bodmer
  (Thanks Bodmer. This project would not be possible without you)
  ESP8266Audio by Earle F. Pillhower III
  NeoPixelBus by Makuna
  DS3232RTC by Jack Christensen
  Time by Paul Stoffregen
  The ESP32 Board support Package for Arduino by espressif

Thanks and credit to all of them. A few of these files are from Bodmer's libraries. They are included as that is how he intended for them to be employed in the project.
